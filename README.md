### Overview

With this app, you can play traditional rock paper scissors or ever ramp it up with a more challenging haunted mode!

Try it for yourself [here](https://echory.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/).

### How does it work?

On page load, you will be presented with two game play options. Classic or haunted. Clicking the classic button will take you to a classic game of rock paper scissors where you can choose your fighter and play against the computer. If you want to spice things up a bit, you can click the change game button and then select the haunted mode. This includes two more fighters to choose from to make the game more interesting. The scoreboard will change as you win!
